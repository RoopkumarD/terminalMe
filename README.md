## TerminalMe

My take on a web terminal using SvelteKit.

Currently, it serves as a portfolio for me. As for the future, let's wait and see, taking it step by step.

### Reason for making this:

It has been 6 months since I shifted from Windows to Linux. Initially, I had some resistance to using the terminal. All the commands seemed complex to me. However, with time, I started using it regularly, and all the worries and fears faded away, leaving only love for it. When I used Windows, I disliked how long it took for my file explorer to load. But when it comes to using the terminal, I can browse directories and files quickly. This is just one example, but I have grown to love Linux a lot, especially its use of configuration files and everything else. This terminal is just my attempt at creating my own terminal. However, I didn't want to create a fully-fledged terminal all at once, so I decided to start with a portfolio-type terminal. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with the code I have written so far, but since it's a start, I'll leave it as it is for now and gradually improve this terminal over time.
